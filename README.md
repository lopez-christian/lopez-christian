### Hello there 👋🏽

Welcome to my Github 🙂

My name is Christian Lopez 👨🏽. Currently residing in Las Vegas, Nevada 🎰. Majored in Cognitive Neuroscience with a minor in Psychology 🧠 at the University of California - San Diego 🏄🏽‍♂️. Over the past year I have embarked on a journey 🛣 to pursue my interest in Data Science 👨🏽‍💻 and have been thoroughly enjoying the learning process. I'm constantly working on personal projects during my free time and dabbling in cloud computing ☁️ with AWS and GCP. 

Feel free to reach out or visit my blog at https://lopez-christian.github.io/ 

Oh, and I also love anything soccer-related and sports in general. So, lets talk some futbol ⚽️.
